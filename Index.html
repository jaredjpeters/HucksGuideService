I moved to Tillamook in 2010 and quickly started learning to fish the many rivers of the area. I have a passion for fishing, and it is no exaggeration in saying I'm obsessed, <em>just ask my wife!</em> My goal is to share this passion for fishing with others through a fun and exciting fishing experience.

                    <p class="grid-3 text">Recent runs of Coho salmon have provided an awesome opportunity to catch these acrobatic fish in the ocean, typically during July and August.  Given that the coho run typically has strict timing and quota limits, trip availability will vary.  Coho and summer chinook salmon are some of the freshest runs of salmon since they are coming straight out of the Pacific ocean.  Our 24’ Willie Nemesis will be utilized for this trip.  Bottom fishing can be included as a part of these trips depending on what you and the rest of the crew want do.  These trips will also include the opportunity to catch some of the prized Dungeness crab.</p>

                    <p class="grid-3 text">Fishing for fall chinook salmon is one of the most popular trips we offer.  From mid August through the end of November, we will be chasing fall chinook as they make their way from the Pacific ocean up to their spawning grounds in one of the many rivers in the Tillamook area.  Early in the season, before the fall rains, we will fishing from our 24’ Willie Nemesis in the ocean or local bays (Tillamook, Nehalem, Nestucca) depending on conditions.  During this time, trips will also include the opportunity for you to pull crab pots (set the day before) depending on ocean conditions.  Later in the season, we will be fishing one of the many local rivers (Trask, Wilson, Nestucca, Nehalem, Kilchis) from our 17’ Willie drift boat.  Given the ever changing conditions and the abundance of rivers to choose from in the area, we have the flexibility to switch rivers throughout the day in order to maximize the chances of catching fish.  Due to the weather in October and November, I will try to check in with you about a week before your trip to let you know about the conditions to expect. If mother nature takes a turn for the worse and the rivers “blow” out, we will need to be flexible and pick a new date for you.</p>

Given the methods used to pursue these fish, be ready to hone your casting skills!  Our Willie drift boat (heated for those cold mornings) will be used to maneuver down one of the many local rivers (Trask, Wilson, Nestucca, Nehalem, Kilchis).  Depending on your interests and fishing conditions, these trips can target hatchery fish to fill your freezer or the iconic wild steelhead (which is a catch and release species).  Certain rivers are better for targeting hatcher vs wild fish, so let me know what you are interested in when you book your trip.  Due to the weather this time of the year, I will try to check in with you about a week before your trip to let you know about the conditions to expect.

The ocean and local bays (typically the Nestucca and Tillamook) will be our best chance to chase down these tasty fish.  Pound for pound, these are the hardest fighting fish of the year.

                    <h2>What you need to bring:</h2>

                    <span>Fishing License:</span>
                    Prior to your trip you will need to purchase a fishing license and salmon/steelhead tag.  If you choose to buy a one day fishing license, everything you need is included in that license.  
                    <br>
                    <span>Breakfast/Lunch:</span>
                    These trips typically last a good portion of the day and start first thing in the morning, so it is a good idea that you eat an adequate breakfast before you arrive &amp bring a lunch.  We will be active all day, so foods that are easy to eat will be the best way to keep you fishing. 
                    <br>
                    <span>Cooler:</span>
                    While no one can guarantee fish <em>don’t believe them if they say they can</em>, we strive to give you the best opportunity to go home with some fish for your fridge. If you “get em”, we will personally process and seal your catch in our commercial grade sealer &amp pack your fish on ice for your trip home.  
                </div>
                <div id="col-2" class="col-2 grid-4 clearfix">
                    <h2>Important things to remember:</h2>

                    <span>Bathroom breaks:</span>
                    On most trips, we will not be around any bathroom facilities, so it is best to take care of your business beforehand if possible.  On ocean trips this is especially important since we could be several miles offshore.  Your comfort is our number one goal, so we can always run back into the marina if needed.  On river trips we will let you know of the best times and places to go, <em>however they will most likely be in the woods.</em>   
                    <br>
                    <span>Sea Sickness:</span>
                    Ocean and lower estuary conditions can lead to motion sickness.  If you have never been in these conditions &amp have booked a trip that includes fishing in these areas we suggest that you consider taking a sea sickness medication as a precaution. 
                    <br>
                    <span>Clothing:</span>
                    Watch the coastal forecasts and dress accordingly.  It is never a bad idea to bring rain gear!
